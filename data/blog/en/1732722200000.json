  "content": "<h2>Why Photos Matter on eBay</h2>\n<p>On eBay, your photos are your salesperson. Buyers can't physically inspect items, so they rely entirely on images to make purchasing decisions. Research shows that listings with high-quality photos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get <strong>3x more views</strong> than listings with poor photos</li>\n<li>Sell <strong>50% faster</strong> on average</li>\n<li>Receive <strong>fewer returns</strong> due to accurate representation</li>\n<li>Command <strong>higher prices</strong> - up to 20% more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>eBay Image Requirements</h2>\n<p>Before diving into tips, let's cover eBay's basic requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minimum size:</strong> 500 x 500 pixels</li>\n<li><strong>Recommended:</strong> 1600 x 1600 pixels for zoom</li>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> JPEG, PNG, or GIF</li>\n<li><strong>Up to 24 photos</strong> per listing (use them all!)</li>\n<li><strong>No borders, text, or artwork</strong> on images</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>10 Tips for Better eBay Photos</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Use Natural Lighting</h3>\n<p>Natural light is free and produces the best results. Photograph near a large window during daytime. Avoid direct sunlight which creates harsh shadows - cloudy days or north-facing windows provide ideal diffused light.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Create a Clean Background</h3>\n<p>White or light gray backgrounds work best. They look professional and don't distract from the product. Use <a href=\"https://pixelift.pl/tools/remove-background\">Pixelift Background Remover</a> to instantly create clean white backgrounds.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Show Multiple Angles</h3>\n<p>Include photos from every angle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front view</li>\n<li>Back view</li>\n<li>Side views (both sides)</li>\n<li>Top and bottom if relevant</li>\n<li>45-degree angles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>4. Capture Important Details</h3>\n<p>Close-up shots of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brand labels and tags</li>\n<li>Serial numbers or authenticity markers</li>\n<li>Material textures</li>\n<li>Any unique features</li>\n<li>Defects or wear (for used items)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>5. Show Scale</h3>\n<p>Help buyers understand size by including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common objects for reference (coin, ruler)</li>\n<li>The item being worn or held</li>\n<li>Measurements overlay on image</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>6. Keep It Steady</h3>\n<p>Blurry photos kill sales. Use a tripod or rest your phone/camera on a stable surface. Most smartphones have stabilization - use it.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Edit for Consistency</h3>\n<p>All photos in a listing should have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Same background color</li>\n<li>Similar lighting</li>\n<li>Consistent color temperature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>8. Optimize Image Size</h3>\n<p>If your images are small, use <a href=\"https://pixelift.pl/tools/upscaler\">Pixelift AI Upscaler</a> to enlarge them to 1600+ pixels for the zoom feature.</p>\n\n<h3>9. Be Honest About Condition</h3>\n<p>For used items, clearly photograph any:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scratches or scuffs</li>\n<li>Stains or discoloration</li>\n<li>Missing parts</li>\n<li>Signs of wear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This builds trust and reduces returns.</p>\n\n<h3>10. Use All Photo Slots</h3>\n<p>eBay allows 24 photos - use as many as possible. More photos = more buyer confidence = more sales.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Photo Mistakes</h2>\n<p>Avoid these sales-killing errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cluttered backgrounds</strong> - distracts from product</li>\n<li><strong>Poor lighting</strong> - makes products look cheap</li>\n<li><strong>Stock photos only</strong> - buyers want to see actual item</li>\n<li><strong>Watermarks</strong> - against eBay policy</li>\n<li><strong>Screenshots of other listings</strong> - unprofessional</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Equipment You Need</h2>\n<p>You don't need expensive gear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smartphone</strong> - modern phones have excellent cameras</li>\n<li><strong>White poster board</strong> - for backgrounds ($2)</li>\n<li><strong>Desk lamp</strong> - for additional lighting</li>\n<li><strong>Tripod or phone stand</strong> - for stability ($15-30)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Great eBay photos don't require professional equipment - just good technique and the right tools. Focus on clean backgrounds, multiple angles, proper lighting, and honest representation. Use AI tools like Pixelift to quickly create professional-looking images that sell.</p>",
